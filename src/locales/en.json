          "question": "Is my uploaded content data safe?",

        "wrongAnswers": {
          "question": "What happens if I answer questions wrong frequently?",
          "answer": "In Qzvert's world, wrong answers aren't failure - they're learning! If you answer wrong, your Energy might decrease or the story might become more challenging. But don't worry, our AI will send \"Hints\" or secret helpers to help you improve and conquer the boss again."
