We don't just let you read or watch - we let you \"play a role\" and use real knowledge to conquer missions, making learning as fun as playing an RPG game."

        "wrongAnswers": {
          "question": "What happens if I answer questions wrong frequently?",
          "answer": "In Qzvert's world, wrong answers aren't failure - they're learning! If you answer wrong, your Energy might decrease or the story might become more challenging. But don't worry, our AI will send \"Hints\" or secret helpers to help you improve and conquer the boss again."

          "question": "How accurate is the AI processing?",
